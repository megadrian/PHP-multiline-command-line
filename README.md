# PHP-multiline-command-line
The problem with the php -a (interactive mode), it only allows you to paste code with leading spaces.
Pasting codes with tabs triggers the autocomplete and thus prevents you to test codes properly without having to remove tabs.

This allows you to paste multiline codes with tabs.
