# PHP-multiline-command-line

The problem with the php -a (interactive mode), it only allows you to paste code with leading spaces.

Pasting codes with tabs triggers the autocomplete and thus prevents you to test codes properly without having to remove tabs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

php binary installation

### Installing

Simply run this php file on your terminal

```
php cline.php
```
